Hi, thanks for visiting. My name is Li, not Lee. 

Note: intentionally not including my full name as it is a public website. 

I'm currently a PhD student at Columbia University, Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI).

I earned my master degree in Nutrition from Cornell University and my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from New York Univeristy.

I'm also a registered dietitian. I worked at the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) for my dietetic internship. 

I'm interested in personalized nutrition and nutrition informatics. Here are some past projects related to data science course ([P8105](https://p8105.com/index.html)) I did before:
